  <h3>ICA restaker on Neutron</h3>

üí∏ Given the recent news about Yieldmos being taken down, there is a need for a new restaking solution. InterChadz uses a restaking contract deployed on Neutron where users pay a fee to set up automated stake compounding.

‚öôÔ∏è Built with interchian accounts + authz + Neutron Cron.

## Flow

![flow](flow.png)

### Initial registration flow

1. User sends registration tx to the contract with the network(s) they want to autocompound on and their address
2. The contract creates one ICA on each network for the user
3. Register periodic ICQ for the ICA balance (done in the callback, since we don't know the address beforehand)
4. User send authz tx (for the delegate message) for each ICA, one transaction for each network they want to autocompound on.
